        <h3>Wait, Lasagna with sausage?!?</h3>

        <p> I know what you're thinking right now. Anyone of Italian descent reading this right now probably has
        me in their crosshairs. Forgive me for I only mean the best for you my reader when I say that you absolutely
        need to start making use of sausage in your italian dishes. Why? Well why not?? No really, the fats and
        flavor that are all blended together really add a strong note of umami to this dish.</p>

        <p>One other ingredient that you will want in this other than your standards is, you guessed it. Home. Made. Sauce.
            It may take a little time but its simple to make and the reward is well worth your time. All without adding many
            more items to your shopping list. Follow me you betrayers of true Italian cuisine.
