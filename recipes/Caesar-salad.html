    <h2>Rich savory dressing tops this vibrant appetizer. Pairs well with Lasagna! Find our recipe here <a href="Lasagna.html">Lasagna</a></h2>

    <p>Are you still with me on this assortment of easy cuisines? Good, cause I have one more for you and it is as easy as opening a bag of
        lettuce and topping it. Its a simple appetizer that you can make even better with homemade dressing. Just a heads up, it has anchovies in it.
        If you aren't a fan then honestly just stick to store-bought as it often lacks this key essential ingredient. For the sake of Simplicity we
        are using store bought dressing. Don't blink, you'll be eating salad in 10 minutes.
