<h3>A rich southern comfort dish that both quick to make and delicious!</h3>

<p>This dish is made with easiness in mind. Most of these ingredients are already in you're household (I would hope).
    Simplicity of this dish reminds me why I miss my mother's cooking. It's not oversaturated with
    expensive ingredients or difficult task. Put it all together in a baking dish, cover with instant stovetop stuffing 
    mix and bake till bubbly. If that needs to be any simpler I don't think that you should be cooking. Offense intended.
</p>

<p>Best part about this recipe is that it can be substituted as you see fit. Don't like chicken? Use beef or pork, the base of
    the recipe is so interchangeble. Prefer not to use creem of chicken? Use another rich soup base, it's your life! Better yet,
    don't liek vegetables? You know where I'm going with this. But enough ranting, it would be finished by the time you were done reading this
    description.
